# canvas-grid-master

Canvas-grid-master is an endless grid in canvas to browse a bunch of images stored in a folder.
Work in progress.

I am exploring two options :
* One that starts from that GitHub project : https://github.com/spoeken/infinite-canvas-grid
* And another from scratch (more succesfull for the moment)


## To Do :

### Features
* Support image
* Optimize draw function


### Nice to have
* Add easing
* Add black tiles when the wall is moving before revealing the tiles
* Add animation when new tiles appear
